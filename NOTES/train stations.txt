Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of the example query:

Assuming you have two tables in your database: trains and train_stations.

The trains table has columns for the train's train_number, start_position, and stop_position. For example:

lua
Copy code
| train_number | start_position | stop_position |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| 123          | Delhi          | Mumbai        |
| 456          | Kolkata        | Chennai       |
| 789          | Mumbai         | Bangalore     |
The train_stations table has columns for the train's train_number and the station_name at which the train stops. For example:

lua
Copy code
| train_number | station_name |
|--------------|--------------|
| 123          | Delhi        |
| 123          | Agra         |
| 123          | Jaipur       |
| 123          | Mumbai       |
| 456          | Kolkata      |
| 456          | Bhubaneswar  |
| 456          | Vishakapatnam|
| 456          | Chennai      |
| 789          | Mumbai       |
| 789          | Goa          |
| 789          | Bangalore    |
To display the train start position and stop position in MySQL by station names, you can use a SELECT statement with a JOIN clause. Here's
























To display the train start position and stop position in MySQL by station names, you can use a SELECT statement with a JOIN clause. Here's an example of how you could do this:

SQL
Copy code
SELECT t.train_number, t.start_position, t.stop_position
FROM trains t
JOIN train_stations ts_start ON t.train_number = ts_start.train_number
JOIN train_stations ts_stop ON t.train_number = ts_stop.train_number
WHERE ts_start.station_name = 'Delhi' AND ts_stop.station_name = 'Mumbai';
In this example, we're selecting the train_number, start_position, and stop_position columns from the trains table. We're joining the train_stations table twice - once for the start position and once for the stop position - using the train_number column to match the rows.

We're filtering the results to only include trains that stop at the specified start and stop stations (in this case, Delhi and Mumbai) by using WHERE clauses that match the station_name column in the train_stations table.

Note that this assumes that the start position and stop position are stored as columns in the trains table. If the positions are stored in the train_stations table instead, you may need to modify the query accordingly.
